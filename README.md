# signal-dev-doc-deck

`signal-dev-doc-deck` is a focused Rust codebase around build a Rust toolkit that studies doc behavior through capacity fixtures, with allocation and spill reports and no network dependency. It is meant to be easy to inspect, run, and extend without a hosted service.

## Signal Dev Doc Deck Walkthrough

I would read the project from the outside in: command, fixture, model, then roadmap. That keeps the developer tools idea grounded in files that can be checked locally.

## Reason For The Project

This is not a wrapper around a service. It is a self-contained project that shows how the model behaves when demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight move in different directions.

## Where Things Live

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands
- `Cargo.toml`: Rust package metadata

## Capabilities

- Includes extended examples for safe defaults, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents repeatable output tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## How It Is Put Together

The interesting part is the boundary between accepted and reviewed scenarios. Extended examples sit near that boundary so future edits can show whether the model became more permissive or more cautious. The Rust code keeps ownership and data movement plain, which makes the tests useful for checking both behavior and API shape.

## Getting It Running

Install Rust and run the commands from the repository root. The project does not need credentials or a hosted service.

## Data Notes

The examples are meant to be readable before they are exhaustive. They cover enough variation to show how latency and risk can pull a decision below the threshold.

## Command Examples

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Check The Work

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Possible Extensions

- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add one more developer tools fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Tradeoffs

The examples cover useful edges, not every edge. A larger version would add malformed-input tests, richer reports, and deeper domain parsers.
